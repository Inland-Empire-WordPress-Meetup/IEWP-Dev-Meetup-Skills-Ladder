Do you want to share your WordPress skills with our group?

Our Meetup takes place on the first Tuesday of every month, and we are always looking for speakers. Attendance is usually around 15 members with diverse skill sets.

We are always looking for speakers, so please do not be shy.  In many instances, we may pair your presentation with similar presenters, so you don’t have to worry about presenting for a full hour or more.
