Greg has become well-known in the WordPress community as a speaker and teacher. He has presented at several conferences (including TechPHX, WordCamp LA, WordCamp Phoenix, and WordCamp Vegas), been featured on industry podcasts (such as BusyMarketer and Hit the Mic with Stacy Harris), and regularly appears on popular shows (like <a href="http://www.wpwatercooler.com/" target="_blank">WPwatercooler</a> and his very own <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/marketing-press-tv/id947230933?mt=2">Marketing Press TV</a>). Created the <a href="http://bullhorntowordpress.com/">BullPen plugin</a> for Job Listings
