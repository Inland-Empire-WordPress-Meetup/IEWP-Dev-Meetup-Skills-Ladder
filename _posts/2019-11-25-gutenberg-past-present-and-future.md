It's time once again for our monthly WP General Meetup meeting on Tuesday December 3, 2019, from 7pm til 9pm.

<strong>TOPIC</strong> - GUTENBERG: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE

In this meetup we will take a deep dive into the new Gutenberg Editor.

First we will look at the WordPress &amp; Gutenberg editor's PAST and evaluate reasons why WordPress has made Gutenberg a priority for the past 2 years of development.

We will look at Gutenberg's PRESENT by evaluating what has happened with it right up to the most recent Release of WordPress 5.3.  We will endeavor to shed a bit of light on the FUTURE of the Gutenberg platform and where we can expect the technology to go.

If you are curious about how Gutenberg will affect your life then you will not want to miss this talk.
