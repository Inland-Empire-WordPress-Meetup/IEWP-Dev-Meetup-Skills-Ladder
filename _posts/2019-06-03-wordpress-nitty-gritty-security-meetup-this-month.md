It's time once again for our monthly WP General Meetup meeting on Tuesday June 4, 2019, from 7pm til 9pm.

You've set up your website, you know you need security, what plugin should you use, how do you set it up, how do you read the warnings, troubleshooting, etc. etc. etc. What do you do if you get HACKED anyway. Come to the meeting for more insite into WP security.
