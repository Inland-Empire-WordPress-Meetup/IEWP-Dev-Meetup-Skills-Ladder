<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's been a “totally” hot summer in Southern California and here in </span><a href="https://inlandempirewp.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Inland Empire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we're super ready to celebrate getting through the heat and looking forward to cooler days. We’re grateful for where we are currently and realize that we must also learn from the lessons of our past in order to move forward.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the momentum of the success of our Inaugural WordCamp Riverside to our backs, the Inland Empire WordPress Community and Riverside WordCamp organizing team bring to you our Sophomore WordCamp with great enthusiasm and pleasure.</span>

<b><i>We're throwing it back Y'all!</i></b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, as we look back at the 15 years of WordPress, WordCamp Riverside is looking back even further to the 80s and the age of big hair bands, David Hasselhoff and Deloreans to bring you</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a “blast from the past.”</span></i>
