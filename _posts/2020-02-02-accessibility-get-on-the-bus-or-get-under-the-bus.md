It's time once again for our monthly WP General Meetup meeting on Tuesday February 4, 2020, from 7pm til 9pm.

<strong>TOPIC</strong> - Accessibility, Get On The Bus or Get Under The Bus

Guest Speaker: Glen Ingram

Glen will explain what web accessibility (WCAG 2.1) is and why it is so important we understand it and be compliant. People with disabilities ranging from blindness, deafness, dyslexia and others may navigate and consume content in different ways with assistive technology. Web accessibility is not just for developers, it is just as important for marketers to make it part of their digital marketing to ensure that opportunities for success aren’t missed. When 1 in 5 people have short or long term disability, creating accessible websites can increase your conversions by 20% by being accessible.

Always come with your questions.
